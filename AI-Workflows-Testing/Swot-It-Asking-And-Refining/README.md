# Prompts
--- Big prompt with details

I'd like to buiid a SwiftUI View with the following elements (top to bottom):
1. A title label with the text "What do you want to learn about?"
2. A text field with multiple lines to input with placeholder text "Enter topic here"
3. A HStack with text: "number of cards", an input box that accepts Integers only and a button to generate the cards
4. A scroll view containing the list of cards that are generated

This view should be contained inside a Tab Bar with 2 tabs, "Builder" (this view) and "Decks" (an empty view)
